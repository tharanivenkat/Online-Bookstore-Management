The Bookstore Management System is a web-based platform designed to facilitate online book purchases by providing a structured and user-friendly interface. Built using PHP and MySQL, the system enables users to browse books, view detailed descriptions, add books to a shopping cart, and proceed with purchases. The backend, powered by PHP, manages user authentication, book listings, and order processing while ensuring secure communication with the MySQL database, which stores book details, user information, and transaction records. Key modules include login.php for user authentication, cart.php for shopping cart operations, dbconnect.php for database connectivity, and bookstore.sql for structured data storage. The system follows a modular approach, allowing efficient management of book categories, authors, and orders. Users can register, log in, and explore available books, while administrators can add, update, or remove book listings. The homepage (index.php) serves as the main interface, while pages like description.php provide detailed book information. By integrating essential e-commerce functionalities, this system ensures seamless online book transactions, making it a scalable and efficient solution for bookstore management.
